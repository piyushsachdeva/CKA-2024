## Task 9/40


In this exercise, you will create a Deployment and expose a container port for its Pods. You will demonstrate the differences between the service types ClusterIP and NodePort.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not already have a Kubernetes cluster, you can create a local Kubernetes cluster by following [Day06 Video](https://youtu.be/RORhczcOrWs)
> If you are using KIND, add the port mapping (`extraPortMappings`) at the time of creating the cluster. The Day9 readme has the config for that.

### Task details
1. Create a Service named `myapp` of type `ClusterIP` that exposes port 80 and maps to the target port 80.
2. Create a Deployment named `myapp` that creates 1 replica running the image `nginx:1.23.4-alpine`. Expose the container port 80.
3. Scale the Deployment to 2 replicas.
4. Create a temporary Pod using the image `busybox` and run a `wget` command against the IP of the service.
5. Run a `wget` command against the service outside the cluster.
6. Change the service type so the Pods can be reached outside the cluster.
7. Run a `wget` command against the service outside the cluster.
8. Discuss: Can you expose the Pods as a service without a deployment?
9. Discuss: Under what condition would you use the service types `LoadBalancer`, `NodePort`, `ClusterIP`, and `ExternalName`?
